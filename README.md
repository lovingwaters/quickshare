# QuickShare

QuickShare is a lightweight Android application designed for fast and secure sharing of personal information.
Users can store details such as their name, address, phone number, email, and a custom note — all displayed in collapsible sections for privacy. With a single tap, any field (or all expanded fields) can be shared via Android's built-in sharing system.

QuickShare is built for simplicity, privacy, and speed.
